# Discovery in a Decentralized System

Finding new plugins and themes becomes more complex in a federated ecosystem. To facilitate discoverability, FAIR will maintain at least one Aggregator that functions as a directory of available Repository Nodes and their packages.

## Aggregator Participation

Any Aggregator may choose to list Nodes and packages from the federation. Aggregators may:

- Set their own listing guidelines (unless conflicting with protocol standards).
- Submit their own Aggregators to other Aggregators, forming a recursive discovery chain.

This decentralized structure encourages diversity while maintaining compatibility through the FAIR Protocol.

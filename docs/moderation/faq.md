# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the difference between a Node and an Aggregator?

Think of it this way:

* A **Node** is like a warehouse or a shop that actually *stores and hosts* the plugin/theme packages. Node operators are responsible for the content on their Node.
* An **Aggregator** is like a search engine or a catalog that *indexes information* from many different Nodes and Aggregators. It helps users discover plugins and themes but doesn't host the package files itself. Aggregators decide which Nodes they want to list.

You can read more about them in the [FAIR Directory overview](./discovery.md) (or a similar introductory document if you have one defining these).

## If FAIR is decentralized, how are standards or rules enforced?

FAIR's governance framework relies on a combination of:

* **Clearly Defined Policies:** Documents in the [Governance section](./governance/README.md) outline expectations for participants (e.g., regarding integrity, disclosure, contact information).
* **Label-Based:** Services like FAIR's official Labeler (using an [Ozone-based system](./ozone-labeling-system.md)) can apply labels (e.g., "non-compliant," "security-risk") to Nodes or Aggregators that don't meet standards. These labels are visible and can be used by others to make decisions.
* **Federation Monitors:** These services help ensure that reports aren't suppressed, adding a layer of accountability (see [Integrity Requirements](./governance/integrity.md#redundant-submissions-and-federation-monitors)).
* **Aggregator Discretion:** Aggregators can choose not to list Nodes that don't comply with FAIR standards or their own policies.
* **Community Tools:** Tools like the [FAIR WordPress Plugin](./tools/fair-wordpress-plugin.md) can alert users to non-compliant or risky entities.
Enforcement is less about central control and more about transparency, community-driven signals, and informed choices by participants.

## As a developer, how do I get my plugin or theme listed across FAIR?

There's no single central submission point to FAIR itself for plugins; it's a federated process via Nodes and Aggregators. You can find more about the general process in the [Submissions Overview](./submissions/README.md).

The basic process is as follows:

1. **Submit to a Node:** Find one or more Nodes that accepts submissions and submit your code to them, following their specific guidelines.
2. **Node Submits to Aggregators (or is already listed):** The Node operator is then responsible for getting their Node listed with various Aggregators. If the Node hosting your code is already listed with Aggregators, your code will become discoverable through those Aggregators once the Node indexes it.

## What are "Labels" and how do they affect me as a user or developer?

Labels are digital tags applied to plugins, themes, Nodes, or Aggregators by "Labeler Services" (like FAIR's official one or third-party services). These labels provide information or signals about the entity.

* **For Users:** Labels can help you make informed decisions. For example, a plugin might be labeled `plugin:security-vulnerability:active` (warning you of a risk) or `plugin:community-trusted` (a positive signal). The [FAIR WordPress Plugin](./tools/fair-wordpress-plugin.md) will surface these labels as warnings or indicators.

* **For Developers/Operators:** Labels can reflect the status or reputation of your plugin, Node, or Aggregator. Positive labels can build trust, while negative ones (e.g., `node:non-compliant`) might indicate issues you need to address. Persistent negative labels from reputable labelers could affect your discoverability.

You can learn more about the system in [Ozone Labeling System](./ozone-labeling-system.md) and  Services](./governance-services.md).

## Can I run my own Aggregator? What's involved?

Yes, you can run your own Aggregator. This involves:

1. **Setting up the Aggregator software:** This would be a system capable of indexing metadata from various FAIR Nodes.
2. **Defining your listing policies:** Deciding which Nodes you want to include and your criteria for doing so.
3. **Integrating with Federation Monitors:** You'll need to connect your Aggregator to at least one recognized [Federation Monitor](./governance/integrity.md#redundant-submissions-and-federation-monitors) to comply with FAIR integrity standards.
4. **Implementing disclosure policies:** For example, disclosing any paid listings (see [Disclosure of Affiliations](./governance/integrity.md#disclosure-of-affiliations-and-financial-interests)).
5. **Optionally subscribing to Labeler Services:** To help curate your listings and inform your users.

Running an Aggregator comes with responsibilities to maintain transparency and contribute positively to the ecosystem's health.

## What is a "Federation Monitor" and do I interact with it?

A **Federation Monitor** is a service that acts as an independent, trusted recipient for copies of reports filed within the FAIR network (e.g., reports about plugins, Nodes, etc.). Its main purpose is to ensure reports aren't lost or suppressed by a single Node or Aggregator.

*  **As a User:** You generally won't interact directly with a Federation Monitor. When you submit a report through a compliant system, a copy should automatically be sent to a Monitor in the background.
*  **As a Node Operator:** You need to ensure your system forwards reports correctly.
*  **As an Aggregator Operator:** You are *required* to ensure your Aggregator is connected to and forwards relevant report data to at least one recognized Federation Monitor.

You can find more details in the [Integrity Requirements documentation](./governance/integrity.md#redundant-submissions-and-federation-monitors).

## Does this mean FAIR directory searches will be a free-for-all with no quality control?

Not exactly. While FAIR promotes a broader and more open discovery of plugins and themes, it's not an unmoderated free-for-all. Individual **Aggregators** (which power directory searches) can, and are encouraged to, implement their own listing policies, including subscribing to labels from services like FAIR's official labeler or trusted third-party labelers (see [Ozone Labeling System](./ozone-labeling-system.md) and [Services](./governance-services.md)).

This means:

* **You choose your experience:** Users and site administrators can often select which Aggregators their WordPress site queries, or their chosen Aggregator may offer filtering based on trust signals.
* **Transparency tools:** Tools like the [FAIR WordPress Plugin](./tools/fair-wordpress-plugin.md) will surface warnings and trust indicators about plugins, themes, Nodes, and Aggregators based on community reporting and official labels.

So, while the *potential pool* of discoverable items is larger, FAIR provides mechanisms for informed choices and for Aggregators to curate their listings.

## Who vets the plugins and themes being added to an individual Node?

The **Node owners** are primarily responsible for the content they host and the vetting processes they implement for their Node. They set their own submission guidelines and are accountable for what they distribute.

FAIR's framework encourages Node owners to adopt robust vetting practices, and their performance and the quality of their hosted content may be reflected in labels applied by services. Repeatedly hosting problematic content could lead to negative labels and impact the Node's discoverability or trustworthiness within the wider FAIR ecosystem.

Nodes are not obligated to host every package submitted to them and are required to [disclose any affiliations and connections of financial interests](./governance/integrity.md#disclosure-of-affiliations-and-financial-interests) for transparency regarding paid listings.

## Who vets adding a Node to an Aggregator?

The **Aggregator owners** have the discretion to decide which Nodes they list. Each Aggregator can establish its own criteria for including a Node, which involves:

* Technical checks (e.g., API compliance, security headers).
* Review of the Node's own policies and history.
* Checking for labels applied to the Node by FAIR or other trusted labelers.
* Compliance with the Aggregator's terms of service.

Aggregators are not obligated to list every Node submitted to them and are required to [disclose any affiliations and connections of financial interests](./governance/integrity.md#disclosure-of-affiliations-and-financial-interests) for transparency regarding paid listings.

## So I could make my own Node with my own plugins and themes?

**Absolutely!** This is one of the core strengths of FAIR â€“ empowering anyone to host and distribute their software. You have full control over your Node and its content.

However, keep in mind:

* **Aggregator Listing is Not Guaranteed:** While you can run your Node, individual Aggregators are not required to list it. They will make decisions based on their own policies (as mentioned above).
* **Responsibility:** You are responsible for maintaining your Node, ensuring its security, and adhering to FAIR's baseline participation requirements (e.g., contact information, API compliance for discovery).
* **Building Trust:** To increase the chances of being listed by Aggregators and trusted by users, consider implementing clear guidelines, robust vetting for any third-party content you might host, and adhering to best practices outlined in FAIR's documentation.

## Could I be sued for what I host on my Node?

**Yes, potentially.**

As a Node operator, you are publishing content to the internet. Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of the content you host, you could face legal liability for issues such as copyright infringement, distribution of malware, or other illegal content if you are found to be responsible for its distribution.

This is why:

* **Clear Guidelines are Critical:** Establishing and enforcing your own clear terms of service and content submission guidelines for your Node is crucial.
* **Vetting Processes:** Implementing a process for evaluating or vetting content before it's hosted can help mitigate risks.
* **Reporting and Takedown Mechanisms:** Having a clear way for people to report issues with content on your Node and a process for responding to legitimate takedown requests (e.g., DMCA notices) is essential.
* **Understanding Local Laws:** You should be aware of the laws in your jurisdiction regarding online publishing and liability.

FAIR provides a framework for decentralized distribution, but it does not absolve individual Node operators of their legal responsibilities. Neither the Linux Foundation nor FAIR itself is not a legal shield.

## As a Node operator, what is my liability for the content hosted on my Node?

This is a critical question, and understanding your responsibilities is key.

**Legal Liability (Copyright, Illegal Content, etc.):**

* **You, as the Node operator, are generally responsible and potentially liable for complying with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction regarding the content you host.** This includes, but is not limited to:
    * **Copyright Law:** You are responsible for addressing copyright infringement claims (e.g., through DMCA takedown notices or similar legal processes in your region). Hosting copyrighted material without permission can lead to legal action against you.
    * **Other Illegal Content:** Distributing content that is illegal in your jurisdiction (e.g., malware, incitement to violence, child exploitation material) can also result in severe legal consequences for you as the publisher.

**FAIR's View on Accountability (Within the FAIR Ecosystem):**

Within the FAIR protocol's framework, there's a distinction between direct liability for content *behavior* (e.g., a plugin malfunctioning or having a security flaw *after* installation) and accountability for the *systems and processes* around that content on your Node.

* **Accountability for Systems, Signals, and Processes:**
    * While FAIR's model encourages developers to be responsible for the code they write, **Node operators are held accountable by the FAIR community and governance for the systems, signals, and processes by which content is submitted, vetted (according to your Node's policies), displayed, and discovered on your Node.**
    * This means you are accountable for:
        * Implementing and enforcing your Node's submission and content guidelines.
        * How you integrate with FAIR's moderation and labeling systems (e.g., applying labels, responding to threshold warnings).
        * Ensuring transparency about your Node's operations and affiliations.
        * Your processes for handling reported issues or takedown requests.
        * Adhering to FAIR's integrity requirements (e.g., connecting to Federation Monitors).
* **Behavior of Hosted Content:**
    * FAIR's reporting and labeling systems are designed to help identify and flag problematic content *behavior* (like security vulnerabilities or spammy actions) after it's been distributed.
    * If content hosted on your Node is found to be problematic, your Node may receive negative labels, and you would be expected to act on such information (e.g., by removing the content or working with the developer, according to your policies and FAIR guidelines). Persistent failure to manage problematic content responsibly can impact your Node's reputation and standing within the FAIR ecosystem.

**In summary:**

* **Real-world legal liability, especially for copyright and illegal content, rests with you, the Node operator.** It is crucial to understand and comply with the laws applicable to you.
* **Within FAIR, your accountability focuses on maintaining a trustworthy and transparent Node environment** through your operational practices, adherence to FAIR principles, and responsible handling of content issues as they are identified.

## How does FAIR prevent "bad" Nodes or Aggregators from just suppressing reports or negative labels?

FAIR's [Integrity and Transparency Requirements](./governance/integrity.md) are designed to combat this. Key mechanisms include:

* **Redundant Submissions to Federation Monitors:** Reports are sent not just to the Node/Aggregator but also to independent Federation Monitors, creating an external record.
* **Publicly Verifiable Labels:** labels, especially those from FAIR's official labeler, are often public and can be cryptographically signed.
* **Canary Testing:** FAIR may conduct tests to ensure reporting systems are functioning.
* **Community Oversight:** Tools and public metrics feeds can help the community identify services that appear to be acting in bad faith.
Failure to adhere to these integrity standards can lead to an entity being flagged, delisted from official FAIR services, or publicly noted as non-compliant.

## Where can I get legal advice for operating my Node or Aggregator?

Operating a Node or Aggregator involves distributing software and data, which can have legal implications related to copyright, data privacy, terms of service, liability, and other areas. The specific laws and regulations can vary significantly depending on your geographic location, the location of your users, and the nature of the content you handle.

**FAIR, as an organization or protocol, cannot provide legal advice.** The information in this documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal counsel. Neither FAIR nor the Linux Foundation is able to act as your legal counsel for content you host.

If you have legal questions or concerns about operating your Node or Aggregator, it is highly recommended that you **consult with a qualified legal professional**.

Here are some suggestions on how to find appropriate legal counsel:

* **Local Bar Associations:** Many regional or national bar associations offer referral services that can help you find lawyers specializing in relevant areas such as:
    * Technology Law
    * Intellectual Property Law (especially copyright and software licensing)
    * Internet Law
    * Data Privacy Law (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
    * Business Law

* **Lawyers Specializing in Open Source Software:** Some lawyers and law firms specialize in legal issues surrounding free and open source software (FOSS). Searching for legal professionals with this specific expertise might be beneficial, especially concerning licensing.

* **Organizations Supporting Digital Rights or Open Source:** While they may not provide direct legal counsel to individuals or businesses in all cases, organizations like:
    * The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
    * The Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC)
    * Local digital rights groups
    may have resources, guides, or be able to point you towards lawyers who work in these areas. Some may offer clinics or pro bono services for specific types of cases or clients (often non-profits).

* **Referrals:** If you know other individuals or organizations operating similar services, they might be able to refer you to legal professionals they have worked with.

When seeking legal advice, be prepared to discuss the specifics of your Node or Aggregator, the types of content you plan to host or index, your target audience, and your operational practices. A legal professional can help you understand your specific rights and responsibilities, draft appropriate terms of service and privacy policies, and navigate any legal challenges that may arise.

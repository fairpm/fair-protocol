Federated systems must clearly explain when and why content or Repositories are removed.

## Plugin/Theme Removal

- Requires public reason
- Propagated via metadata
- May include license issues, security problems, or author request

## Repository or Aggregator Removal

- Any removal requires a clear rationale and documentation thereof
- FAIR and Aggregators may delist any participant not meeting standards
- Transparency and accountability are mandatory, even if a general explanation is given

Removed Repository or Aggregator managers have the option to [appeal](appeals.md) their removal, however restoration is never a guarantee. No one is forced to host code or list it, and Aggregators can exclude a Repository for any reason.

FAIR aims to ensure users are never left in the dark by requiring documentation of removals.

# Defederation and Removal Policy

Federated systems must clearly explain when and why content or Nodes are removed.

## Plugin/Theme Removal

- Requires public reason
- Propagated via metadata
- May include license issues, security problems, or author request

## Node or Aggregator Removal

- Requires clear rationale and optional appeal
- FAIR and Aggregators may delist any participant not meeting standards
- Transparency and accountability are mandatory, even if a general explanation is given

FAIR aims to ensure users are never left in the dark.

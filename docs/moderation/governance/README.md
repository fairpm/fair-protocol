# Governance

Decentralization empowers anyone to host and distribute software, but it also requires shared responsibility. The FAIR Protocol defines a governance framework to ensure participants operate transparently, protect user data, and uphold moderation standards.

This section outlines the minimum expectations for all federation members, including:

- Contact and privacy requirements
- Integration with federation-wide moderation systems like Ozone
- Compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR)

All Nodes and Aggregators must adhere to these requirements to remain part of the FAIR ecosystem. Governance is not about central control — it’s about maintaining mutual trust, accountability, and safety across a distributed network.

## Topics

- [Contact and Privacy Requirements](./contact-and-privacy.md)
- [Integrity and Transparency Requirements](./integrity.md)
- [Vetting and Reporting](./vetting-and-reporting.md)
- [Defederation and Removal Policy](./defederation.md)

More documents may be added as the federation evolves to include appeals processes, escalation procedures, or delegated authority models.

# Appeals Process for FAIR Moderation Decisions

The FAIR protocol aims to foster a just and transparent ecosystem. While our moderation and governance systems are designed to be fair and consistently applied, we recognize that errors can occur or new information may come to light. This document outlines the appeals process for decisions made by FAIR working groups or through FAIR-operated automated systems (such as the application of certain high-impact labels via the FAIR Labeler Service).

## Purpose of the Appeals Process

The appeals process serves several key functions:

- **Rectify Errors:** To provide a mechanism for correcting mistakes in judgment or application of FAIR policies.
- **Ensure Fairness:** To offer recourse to those who believe a decision made by FAIR was unjust, disproportionate, or based on incomplete information.
- **Improve Policies:** To gather feedback that can help refine FAIR's governance policies and moderation practices over time.
- **Maintain Trust:** To demonstrate FAIR's commitment to accountability and due process within the federation.

## Scope of Appeals Handled by FAIR

This appeals process applies specifically to:

- **Removal or Suspension from FAIR-Operated Services:** Decisions to delist or suspend a Node or Aggregator from a directory or service directly operated by FAIR.
- **Application of Critical FAIR-Issued Labels:** Challenges to specific, high-impact moderation labels (e.g., `fair:threshold:suspended75`, `plugin:malicious` if disputed) applied by the official FAIR Labeler Service, particularly if these labels result in widespread negative consequences across the ecosystem.
- **Decisions made by FAIR Working Groups:** Formal findings or sanctions issued by a designated FAIR working group related to governance or moderation.

**Important Note:** This process **does not** cover:

- Decisions made by independent Node operators regarding content they host.
- Decisions made by independent Aggregator operators regarding listings on their services (unless the decision is a direct pass-through of a FAIR-issued label being appealed).
- General disagreements with FAIR policies (policy feedback should be directed through community discussion channels, though an appeal might highlight a policy's unintended consequence).

Individual Nodes and Aggregators are encouraged, but not required by FAIR, to offer their own appeals or dispute resolution mechanisms for decisions they make independently.

## Who Can Submit an Appeal?

Appeals can be submitted by:

- The primary maintainer(s) of a Node or Aggregator directly affected by a FAIR decision.
- The primary developer(s) or maintainer(s) of a plugin or theme directly impacted by a critical FAIR-issued label.

## Grounds for Appeal

Valid grounds for an appeal may include, but are not limited to:

- **Factual Error:** The decision was based on incorrect or incomplete information.
- **Misapplication of Policy:** FAIR's policies or guidelines were not correctly applied to the specific case.
- **New Evidence:** Significant new information has become available that was not considered during the initial decision.
- **Procedural Irregularity:** A significant flaw in the decision-making process itself.
- **Disproportionate Action:** The action taken was significantly disproportionate to the issue identified.

## The Appeals Process

1. **Submission:**
    * Appeals must be submitted via [Specify Method - e.g., a dedicated email address, a web form on the FAIR website/documentation portal].
    * The appeal should be submitted within 60 days of the notification of the decision being appealed.

2. **Required Information:**
    * Appellant's name and contact information.
    * Clear identification of the decision or label being appealed (e.g., Node URL, Plugin slug, date of decision, specific label).
    * A detailed explanation of the grounds for the appeal (see above).
    * Any supporting evidence (e.g., logs, screenshots, corrected information).
    * The desired outcome of the appeal.

3.  **Review:**
    * Appeals will be reviewed by a designated FAIR Appeals Working Group, which will be independent of the body that made the initial decision where possible.
    * The Appeals Working Group may request further information from the appellant or other relevant parties.
    * The review process will aim to be completed within 60 days, though complex cases may take longer. Appellants will be kept informed of the progress.

4.  **Decision:**
    * The Appeals Working Group will issue a written decision, outlining the reasons for upholding, overturning, or modifying the original decision.
    * Possible outcomes include:
        * **Appeal Upheld:** The original decision is overturned or modified.
        * **Appeal Partially Upheld:** Parts of the original decision are modified, while others stand.
        * **Appeal Denied:** The original decision stands.
    * The decision of the Appeals Working Group is typically final within the FAIR process.

## Transparency and the Appeals Viewer

- Summaries of appeal decisions (anonymized where appropriate to protect privacy) may be made publicly available to ensure transparency and help the community understand the application of FAIR policies.
- As envisioned in the [Ozone Labeling System](../ozone-labeling-system.md) documentation, an "Appeals Viewer" component may be developed. This tool would provide a human-readable interface for tracking the status of appeals and reviewing (potentially signed and verifiable) appeal decisions, possibly by querying the ATProto record graph where appeal outcomes might be logged as label events or signed records.

## Limitations

While FAIR strives for a comprehensive appeals process for its own actions, it cannot compel independent Node or Aggregator operators to adopt a specific appeals mechanism. Developers or operators interacting with third-party services should consult the policies of those individual services.

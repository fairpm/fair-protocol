To foster an open and inclusive federated ecosystem, anyone may submit their content (packages,Repositories, or Aggregators) for inclusion in the FAIR network.

- **Developers** can submit their packages to a Repository for hosting.
- **Repository operators** can submit their Repository to an Aggregator for indexing.
- **Aggregator maintainers** can submit their Aggregator to a Discovery Service for broader federation.

While open listing is encouraged, it is _not_ required. However, any Repository or Aggregator that allows public submissions must comply with all FAIR Protocol guidelines, including moderation and reporting requirements.

The submission process is designed to be straightforward and accessible while ensuring that each participant meets the technical and policy standards necessary for federation compatibility.

- [Packages to a Node](./packages.md)
- [Repositories to an Aggregator](./repositories.md)
- [Aggregators to a Discovery Service](./aggregators.md)

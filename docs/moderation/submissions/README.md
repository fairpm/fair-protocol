# Submissions

To foster an open and inclusive ecosystem, anyone may submit their content (packages, plugins, Nodes, or Aggregators) for inclusion in the FAIR network.

- **Developers** can submit their plugins or themes to a Repository Node for hosting.
- **Node operators** can submit their Node to an Aggregator for indexing.
- **Aggregator maintainers** can submit their Aggregator to a Discovery Service for broader federation.

While open listing is encouraged, it is _not_ required. However, any Node or Aggregator that allows public submissions must comply with all FAIR Protocol guidelines, including moderation and reporting requirements.

The submission process is designed to be straightforward and accessible while ensuring that each participant meets the technical and policy standards necessary for federation compatibility.

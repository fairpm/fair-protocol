# Security

Security is at the heart of the FAIR system, and is a fundamental design principle of the system.


## Ownership of DIDs

FAIR is designed to protect against a plugin being hijacked by anyone else. This is incorporated into the core design of the system, with the use of Decentralized IDs that cannot be controlled by any one entity.

For PLC DIDs, these IDs are published to the PLC registry, and a full audit log is available for each.


## 

Rather than repositories publishing a list of IDs and controlling these directly, DIDs contain a pointer to which repository to use. This allows publishers to change repositories
